<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>dozdc</b> An
arbitrary-precision Reverse Polish Notation (RPN, postfix
notation) calculator which works in dozenal (base-12). All
normal arithmetic functions, plus trigonometry, some basic
constants (pi, euler, phi), logarithms, and other functions.
Supports variables of arbitrary user-defined names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is also a
graphical version, gdozdc, written in Perl/Tk. Obviously,
this requires a working version of Perl and the Tk
libraries. gdozdc is pretty self-explanatory; its
differences are described below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-k precision</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Print the resulting output with
<i>precision</i> digits of precision. By default, the output
is printed with four digits after the zenimal point. If
there is no fractional part, no zenimal point or fractional
digits will be printed, even if this option is specified. If
the precision is too high, a message will be printed noting
this, and the precision will be reduced to the
system&rsquo;s maximum.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">equation</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If present, must be the final
argument at the command line. Processes the equation, prints
the answer, and exits. Must be entered within quotation
marks so that it&rsquo;s considered a single argument by the
program.</p>

<h2>EQUATION SYNTAX
<a name="EQUATION SYNTAX"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The syntax of
an equation is fairly standard Reverse Polish Notation (also
called postfix notation or simply RPN). Each operator has
either two arguments (these are called &quot;binary&quot;
operators) or one (these are called &quot;unary&quot;
operators). Operators (like &quot;+&quot; or
&quot;cos&quot;) come <i>after</i> their arguments (that is,
the numbers or variables they work on). So, for example,
rather than writing &quot;1 + 1&quot;, one writes &quot;1 1
+&quot;; rather than writing cos(30), one writes &quot;30
cos&quot;. This has the benefit of being unambiguous (no
parentheses are necessary).</p>

<h2>OPERATORS

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pops and prints the top of the
stack; in other words, gives you your answer. The operations
you request will be done after hitting &quot;enter&quot;;
however, no answer will be printed unless you put in an
&quot;=&quot; and hit that. This allows long calculations to
be split between lines without having intermediate results,
which may not be interesting, printed unless you want them
to be.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">+, -, *, /</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The basic arithmetic operators;
they are all binary. They work precisely as one would expect
them to. &quot;-&quot; and &quot;/&quot; must have their
arguments in the right order; however, this is the same as
the order one would expect. &quot;x - y&quot; is &quot;x y
-&quot;; &quot;x / y&quot; is &quot;x y /&quot;. So this
shouldn&rsquo;t trip anyone up. Of course, one cannot divide
by zero; trying will emit an error message, and the numbers
will be pushed back onto the stack, as they were before the
attempt.</p>

<p>%</p></td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>The modulus operator, or &quot;mod&quot;. Internally
this is fmod(); as such, it works on floating-point numbers
as well as integers. Like &quot;/&quot;, one cannot divide
by zero; trying will emit an error message, and the numbers
will be pushed back onto the stack, as they were before the
attempt.</p> </td></tr>

<td width="1%">


<p>k</p></td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Precision; this is a unary operator. As such, its
argument comes prior to it. It pops the last number and
makes that value the new precision. Obviously, fractional
precisions are meaningless, and will be truncated to a whole
number. Enter like so: &quot;8 k&quot; will ask that answers
be printed to eight zenimal places. If the value is too
large, then, as with the command-line option, it will simply
be reduced to the largest possible on your machine.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">sin, cos, tan</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Trigonometric functions that
we&rsquo;re all familiar with. These are unary operators, so
they take the number entered immediately before them as
their argument. By default, they operate on zeniPis; this
can be changed. See the command &quot;rad&quot; and the
command-line option &quot;r&quot;, as well as &quot;d&quot;
and the command-line option &quot;d&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">asin, acos, atan</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Inverse trigonometric
functions. Unary; used like the normal trigonometric
functions. Naturally, these must be in the range of -1 to 1
(except for atan, which can take any real number); if they
are fed a different value, they politely cough it back onto
the stack and let the user know. They emit values in radians
or degrees, depending on the current angle setting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">sinh, cosh, tanh</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Hyperbolic trigonometric
functions. Unary; used like the normal and inverse ones.</p>

<p>^</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>A binary operator; it raises its first argument to the
power of its second argument. So &quot;2 3 ^&quot; has a
result of 8; it means &quot;2 raised to the power of
3&quot;. This can also be used to fake roots greater than
two; &quot;8 1 3 / ^&quot; raises 8 to the power of 1/3,
which gives the cube root of 8.</p></td></tr>

<p>v</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>A unary operator; it takes the square root of its single

cannot take the square root of a negative number; trying
will emit an error message, and the attempted argument will
be pushed back onto the stack unchanged.</p></td></tr>

<p>A unary operator; gives the base-ten logarithm of its
single argument. It&rsquo;s worth noting that this computes
the base-ten logarithm of a <i>dozenal</i> number and emits
it as a <i>dozenal</i> result. This fact has tripped up the
author of the program a few times when it didn&rsquo;t match
up to a base-ten logarithm from another calculator. Trust
the result; make sure you&rsquo;re entering the same number
and converting the result to decimal. It&rsquo;s

<p>logb</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>A binary operator; permits computation of logs in an
arbitrary base. Its first argument is the number the log of
which is sought; its second is the base of that log. So, for
example, &quot;45 log&quot; is equivalent to &quot;45 10
logb&quot;; &quot;45 logx&quot; is equivalent to &quot;45 X
logb&quot;; and &quot;45 ln&quot; is equivalent to &quot;45

<h2>CONSTANTS
<a name="CONSTANTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">dozdc provides
a number of constants. These are the classic
&quot;transcendental&quot; numbers, or at least a few of
them. Of course, they are emitted in dozenal. The
&quot;=&quot; syntax is helpful here; to learn the dozenal
value of pi, for example, one need simply tell dozdc
&quot;pi =&quot;, and pi, the value at the top of the stack,
will be printed.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pi</p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Takes no arguments; simply
contains the value of pi.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p>eul</p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>

<td width="4%">


<p>phi</p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Takes no arguments; simply contains the value of phi,
the &quot;Golden Ratio.&quot;</p></td></tr>
</table>

<h2>VARIABLES
<a name="VARIABLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">dozdc has basic
variable handling; it is basic, but it&rsquo;s powerful
enough for many uses. The program allows for up to fifty
separate variables, each of which can be arbitrarily named.
These names can be up to thirty characters long; longer and
they will be silently truncated by the program. The names
must begin with a dollar sign (&rsquo;$&rsquo;), after the
manner of Perl or bash.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first time
a variable name appears, the last value on the stack is
popped off the stack and assigned to it; ever after, when
the variable name appears it pushes that value back onto the
stack. The variable cannot be assigned a new value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So, for
example, a typical usage scenario might be such:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>1 3 /
$result ($result == 1/3, or 0;4)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>8 $result ^
= (prints 8 ^ 0;4, the cube root of 8,</b> which is
2)&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">They really are
that simple.</p>

<h2>COMMENTS
<a name="COMMENTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Comments are
available, and are useful in particularly long or complex
files that will be handed to dozdc for computation. Because
dozdc works by words, not by lines, comments are word-based.
Fortunately, the words can be as long as one wants.
It&rsquo;s important, however, to make sure that the
comments contain no spaces, tabs, or newlines, or dozdc will
misinterpret the text after the first one such as a command
or number it needs to deal with.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Comments are
all proceeded with the &rsquo;#&rsquo; character, and
include all characters following it in the same word. So, in
our above variable example, we might do the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>1 3 /
$result</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>#_gives_us_exponent_for_cube_roots</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>8 $result ^
=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This will
accomplish the same thing, but make it clear what
&quot;$result&quot; is doing explicitly. (Of course, one
could just name the variable &quot;$cuberoot&quot; or
something similar, but we&rsquo;re doing examples here.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One should be
aware that blank lines in the input files will mess up the
results, because of the way dozdc deals with words. However,
inserting a comment (a line consisting solely of
&rsquo;#&rsquo;) rather than a blank line will preserve a
correct result while still allowing the helpful
whitespace.</p>

<h2>GRAPHICAL VERSION, gdozdc
<a name="GRAPHICAL VERSION, gdozdc"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">gdozdc is the
graphical version of dozdc, and it differs in some
significant points. Specifically, it&rsquo;s <i>infix,</i>
not postfix; that means that you enter your equations in the
same way you learned to write them down in school, with your
binary operators (the ones that take two arguments, like the
basic arithmetic functions) in between their two arguments.
E.g., you write &quot;4 + 5&quot;, rather than dozdc&rsquo;s
&quot;4 5 +&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This system is
not particularly extensible; that is, it only works with
binary operators, and it&rsquo;s inherently ambiguous.
gdozdc therefore offers the usual infix disambiguation
operators, parentheses, which can be used to group
operations however might be necessary. This applies to *all*
binary operators, even ones where this behavior might be
surprising; e.g., for arbitrary base logarithms, one inputs
the base, &quot;logb&quot;, then the number; so for the
logarithm of three to base two, one writes &quot;2 logb
3&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Non-binary
operations work as they do in dozdc; that is, they are
postfix. This is typical even for modern infix calculators.
For example, one writes &quot;5 !&quot; for factorial five,
and &quot;0;6 sin&quot; for the sine of 0;6.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">gdozdc also
implements some memory functions. &quot;CM&quot; means to
clear memory; &quot;M&quot; means to save the current field
to memory (this is the whole field, not the result of the
operations contained in it); &quot;M+&quot; means to replace
the current field with the contents of the memory; and
&quot;M++&quot; means to append the contents of the memory
to the current field.</p>
