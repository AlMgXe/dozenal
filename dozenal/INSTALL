To compile the programs, just type "make". Alternatively, programs can
be compiled individually by running "make" in their corresponding
subdirectory.

To install run "make install". To install binaries only (no docs) run
"make installbin". To install html documentation run "make installhtml".
The commands can of course be combined as "make install installhtml".

Certain paths can be adjusted at install time by setting variables on the
command line, as in:
%make prefix=/usr mandir=/usr/man htmldir=/usr/share/doc/html
