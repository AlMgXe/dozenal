<h1>dozdate:  A Tutorial</h1>

<p><span class="fl">U</span>nix users will be familiar with
the program <span class="prog">date</span>, which simply
outputs the date.  It can be told to output the date or time
in multiple formats, and takes care of a lot of the boring
date-related stuff---like time zones and leap seconds and
the like---for you.  For example:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; date
Tue Jul 19 13:24:02 EDT 2016
</pre>

<p>The above was just run on my machine a moment ago.  Since
I didn't give it a format, <span class="prog">date</span>
output its information in a default format, but I could tell
it to format its output in whatever way I desire.</p>

<p><span class="prog">dozdate</span> is designed to give
this same facilities to users of dozenal.  We'll examine a
few basic concepts here, then the specifics of how to use
<span class="prog">dozdate</span>, and finally an example or
two of how <span class="prog">dozdate</span> can be
integrated into your environment.</p>

<h2>Formatting Strings</h2>

<p>Central to the workings of <span
class="prog">dozdate</span> is the concept  of
<em>formatting strings</em>.  A formatting string is a way
of telling the computer how you want certain data to look,
without having to know what that data is in advance.  The
computer will read the string and output most characters
without change; when it encounters certain characters,
however, it will replace those with another set of text.</p>

<p>Consider the following string:</p>

<pre class="demo">
|-%d-|
</pre>

<p>Imagine that <span class="sdemo">%d</span> is a special
sequence, and that the others are not.  Instead, <span
class="sdemo">%d</span> represents the date; you don't know
what the date is yet, but you know that that's where you'd
like it to be printed.  So, assuming that the date is "14
August 1200", when you run this string through your program,
you'll get:</p>

<pre class="demo">
|-14 August 1200-|
</pre>

<p>The <span class="sdemo">%d</span> is gone, replaced with
what it stood for; the rest of the string is unchanged.</p>

<p>Oftentimes, you can also tell the computer how to display
your replacement text.  For example, if you want it
displayed to a certain number of characters, put that number
between the <span class="sdemo">%</span> and the letter:</p>

<pre class="demo">
|-%20d%-|
</pre>

<p>Remembering that this is dozenal, and 20 means two dozen,
you'll wind up with this:</p>

<pre class="demo">
|-          14 August 1200-|
</pre>

<p>Of course, <span class="sdemo">%d</span> for "date" is
extremely broad; a real date program would offer you lots
more options, so that you can print year, month, day,
weekday, and so forth in whatever format you wish.  <span
class="prog">dozdate</span> gives you this, along with a
number of control sequences beginning with <span
class="sdemo">@</span> (rather than <span
class="sdemo">%</span> which are specific to dozenal (the
others all output in dozenal, as well; but the at-sequences
are specific to dozenal).</p>

<h2>Control Sequences</h2>

This %- and @-letters are called <em>control sequences</em>,
and they are listed completely in <span
class="prog">dozdate</span>'s <a
href="dozdate.html">manual</a>.  For the purposes of this
tutorial, we need to know only a few:</p>

<center>
<table class="realtable">
<tr><th>Seq.</th><th>Meaning</th><th>Example</th></tr>
<tr><td>%a</td><td>Abbreviated weekday</td><td>Mon</td></tr>
<tr><td>%b</td><td>Abbreviated month name</td><td>Mar</td></tr>
<tr><td>%m</td><td>Month number, padding to two digits with
	zeroes</td><td>04</td></tr>
<tr><td>%Y</td><td>Year</td><td>11EE</td></tr>
<tr><td>%H</td><td>Hour, padded to two digits with
	zeroes</td><td>04</td></tr>
<tr><td>%M</td><td>Minute, padded to two digits with
	zeroes</td><td>46</td></tr>
<tr><td>@m</td><td>Number of quadquaTims, to two places;
	basically @t truncated to two places</td><td>E4</td></tr>
<tr><td>@t</td><td>Tims</td><td>6X82</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>This will be enough to get us started.  Remember the
rules:  these sequences will be changed into what they
represent, while other characters will be passed on
unchanged.</p>
