<h1>dozpret:  A Tutorial</h1>

<p><span class="fl">W</span>e often want our numbers to be
more than just a string of digits.  After all,
"8932&nbsp;3894&nbsp;2983;3834&nbsp;3892" is eminently more
readable than "893238942983;38343892".  <span
class="prog">dozpret</span> answers this need:  it is a
"pretty-printer" for dozenal numbers, with a variety of
preset settings and more or less arbitrary
customizability.</p>

<p>For formatting dozenal numbers, we're basically looking
at five different settings:</p>

<ol>
<li>What character should we use for "ten"?</li>
<li>What character should we use for "eleven"?</li>
<li>What should be the digit grouping (that is, numbers
should be grouped into units of how many digits)?</li>
<li>What character should separate the groupings?</li>
<li>What character should we use as a radix point (what we
incorrectly often call a "decimal" point)?</li>
</ol>

<p>1 and 2 we call "transdecimal characters"; 3 and 4 we
call simply "grouping".</p>

<a name="transdec"></a>
<h2>Transdecimal Characters</h2>

<p>We can use any arbitrary character for transdecimals by
using the <span class="prog">dozpret</span> options <span
class="sdemo">-t</span> for the number ten and <span
class="sdemo">-e</span> for the number eleven:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; dozpret -t Y -e F "XE84EX1"
YF8 4FY1
</pre>

<p>(Ignore the space for now; we'll see how to change, or
get rid of, that <a href="#grouping">later</a>.)  Notice
that this substitues "Y" for digit-ten ("X" in the input)
and "F" for digit-eleven ("E" in the input).</p>

<p>Any arbitrary character or characters can be used
here:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; dozpret -t"YY" -e "FF" "XE84EX1"
YYFF8 4FFYY1
</pre>

<p>Essentially, this just means that you can fill in
multiple bytes rather than a single byte; so even Unicode
characters will work:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; dozpret -t `echo -e '\u2620'` -e `echo -e '\u2619'` XEXEXE
<span style="font-size: 150%">☠☙ ☠☙☠☙</span>
</pre>

<p>(We're using a <span class="prog">echo</span> subshell to
display the Unicode, because it's more platform-neutral; you
can ignore this and enter Unicode characters however you
prefer when you try it yourself.)</p>

<p>These particular characters are ridiculous, of course (if
your browser can't display them, we used a
skull-and-crossbones for ten and a left-pointing fleuron for
eleven), but they do show the possibilities.  And notice
that the spacing is the same; this will become important in
a few minutes.</p>

<p>By default, <span class="sdemo">-t</span> is "X" and
<span class="sdemo">-e</span> is "E".</p>

<a name="grouping"></a>
<h2>Grouping and Spacing</h2>

<p>Numbers are often grouped into units of a given number of
digits, and this grouping is by no means consistent across
cultures.  In India, for example, numbers are often grouped
by twos ("12&nbsp;34&nbsp;56.78&nbsp;90&nbsp;12"), while in
America they are typically grouped by threes
("123&nbsp;456.789&nbsp;012").  These are only two examples
of many different practices.</p>

<p><span class="prog">dozpret</span> allows you to group
your numbers by any arbitrary integer, though the default is
four (the most common dozenal grouping).  This default is
why the spaces in our examples above is where you see it.
Grouping is set by the <span class="sdemo">-n</span>
flag:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; dozpret -n2 "XEXEXEXE"
XE XE XE XE
$&gt; dozpret -n4 "XEXEXEXE"
XEXE XEXE
$&gt; dozpret -n3 "XEXEXEXE"
XE XEX EXE
</pre>

<p>As you can see, if there aren't enough digits for an even
grouping, the first full grouping is placed closest to the
radix point.  This means that the less-than-full groups will
be on the left side for whole numbers, and the right side
for fractional parts:

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; dozpret -n3 "XEXEXEXE;XEXEXEXE"
XE XEX EXE;XEX EXE XE
</pre>

<p>You can turn off grouping entirely with <span
class="sdemo">-x</span>:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; dozpret -x -n3 "XEXEXEXE;XEXEXEXE"
XEXEXEXE;XEXEXEXE
</pre>

<p>Of course, the <span class="sdemo">-n3</span> option has
become useless here.</p>

<p>You do <em>not</em> need to use a simple space as the
grouping character, either; you can use any character or
characters, just as you can for the <a
href="#transdec">transdecimal digits</a>, by using the <span
class="sdemo">-s</span> option:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; dozpret -n3 -s",," "XEXEXEXE;XEXEXEXE"
XE,,XEX,,EXE;XEX,,EXE,,XE
</pre>

<a name="radixpoint"></a>
<h2>Radix Points</h2>

<p>Finally, radix points can be changed at will with the
<span class="sdemo">-p</span> option:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; dozpret -p`echo -e '\u2620'` -n3 -s",," "XEXEXEXE;XEXEXEXE"
<span style="font-size:150%">XE,,XEX,,EXE☠XEX,,EXE,,XE</span>
</pre>

<p>Notice that we're again using Unicode characters here,
and that the spacing still turns out correctly.  (This is
another ridiculous choice, the skull-and-crossbones for a
radix point, but one again it demonstrates the
possibilities.)</p>

<a name="presets"></a>
<h2>Preset Shortcuts</h2>

<p><span class="prog">dozpret</span> has a number of preset
options for some common use cases, which we'll examine
here:</p>

<p>Frequently dozenal numbers will be transferred into a
<a href="http://www.ctan.org">LaTeX</a> document (probably
in conjunction with the <a
href="http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dozenal">dozenal
package</a>).  <span class="prog">dozpret</span> offers the
<span class="sdemo">-l</span> option, which outputs
appropriately for the dozenal package:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; dozpret -l "XEXEXE;XEXEXEXE"
\x\e\,\x\e\x\e;\x\e\x\e\,\x\e\x\e
</pre>

<p>LaTeX will turn this into a beautiful dozenal number,
grouped by four, separated by a small space.  If you don't
like a particular choice in this preset, you can change it
easily:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; dozpret -l -p. "XEXEXE;XEXEXEXE"
\x\e\,\x\e\x\e.\x\e\x\e\,\x\e\x\e
</pre>

<p>Just put whatever you'd like changed <em>after</em> the
<span class="sdemo">-l</span>.  This technique will work for
any of the preset options presented here.</p>

<p>To present dozenal numbers textually in a typically
American way, use the <span class="sdemo">-a</span>
option:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; dozpret -a  "XEXEXE;XEXEXEXE"
XEX,EXE;XEX,EXE,XE
</pre>

<p>As can be seen, this option groups by threes, separates
with a comma, and with a semicolon as a radix point.  It
uses "X" and "E" as transdecimals.</p>

<p>The <span class="sdemo">-b</span> option causes <span
class="prog">dozpret</span>'s output to conform to common
British dozenal practice:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; dozpret -b  "XEXEXE;XEXEXEXE"
TE TETE'TETE TETE
</pre>

<p>This consists of "T" and "E" for transdecimals, groupings
by four, spaces as a separator, and an apostrophe for a
radix point.</p>

<p>The <span class="sdemo">-h</span> option makes output
conform to the Hammond standard, of Donald Hammond (DSGB)
fame; this is normal British usage, but with an "X" for
"ten".  Translated directly to <span
class="sdemo">-p";"</span>.</p>

<p>And that's all there is to <span
class="prog">dozpret</span>.  Happy dozening!</p>
