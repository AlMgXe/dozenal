<h1>dec and doz:  A Tutorial</h1>

<p><span class="fl">I</span>f you want to convert decimal to
dozenal or vice versa, then <span class="prog">doz</span>
and <span class="prog">dec</span> are your friends.  They
can convert many numbers in many formats using a variety of
transdecimal characters and can output to user-specified
precision.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>As powerful as they are, however, <span
class="prog">doz</span> and <span class="prog">dec</span> do
have their limitations.  Most specifically, they are
<em>not</em> "arbitrary precision," in that they are limited
in the range of numbers they can accept.  Essentially, they
work with the double-precision floating-point numbers
offered by your machine.  This limitation is, however, very
rarely a problem.  For example, on the low-powered machine
I'm currently working on, the lowest available number is 
2;9816e-210, and the highest is 4;X617e1E9.  It's hard to
imagine a real-world situation, short of some mathematician
experiments, where this will be particularly limiting.</p>

<h2>Basic operation</h2>

<p><span class="prog">dec</span> and <span
class="prog">doz</span> are <em>command-line programs</em>,
meaning that you operate with them by typing commands and
getting responses.  For these examples, <span
class="sdemo">$&gt;</span> will mean the <em>prompt</em>,
where you type your commands; a line without a prompt are
the responses you get.</p>

<p>Most simply, you just type the command, then the number
which you want converted:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; doz 1492
X44
$&gt; doz 1492.33333333333333333
X44;4
$&gt; dec X44
1492
$&gt; dec "X44;4"
1492.3333
</pre>

<p>Notice that the last example has the number surrounded by
quotation marks.   Most systems will interpret a semicolon
as the end of statement, so you need to enclose numbers
containing semicolons in quotations to prevent this.
Otherwise, you'll likely get a funny error:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; dec X44;4
0
bash: 4: command not found
</pre>

<p>This, obviously, is not what you expect or want.</p>

<p>You can enter your numbers in "scientific notation" (more
properly called exponential notation), as well, in the
normal computerized way:  end your mantissa with a lowercase
"e", then put in the exponent:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; doz 1.492e3
X44
$&gt; dec "X;44e2"
1492.0000
</pre>

<h2>Advanced operation</h2>

<p>If you want your <em>result</em> to be in exponential
notation, you need to add a <em>flag</em>.  Flags are
special markers that are put in a command; for <span
class="prog">dec</span> and <span class="prog">doz</span>,
that means <em>before</em> the number that you want
converted.</p>

<p>So to get exponential notation in your output, use the
<span class="sdemo">-e</span> flag:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; doz -e 1.492e3
X;44e2
$&gt; dec -e "X;44e2"
1.4920e+03
</pre>

<p>You might find, eventually, that you don't get the
results you're looking for, and exponential notation could
be the answer:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; doz 4.539e-14
0;0000
$&gt; doz -e 4.539e-14
4;X33Xe-11
</pre>

<p>You can also get variable amounts of precision, with
"precision" defined as "number of digits after the radix
point."  To do this, you use the flag <span
class="sdemo">-k</span> ("k" for "krecision"! (actually,
this is designed for compatibility with the well-known Unix
program <span class="prog">dc</span>)), followed by the
number of digits after the radix point that you want:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; doz 4.539e-14
0;0000
$&gt; doz -k14 4.539e-14
0;0000000000004X33
$&gt; doz -e 4.539e-14
4;X33Xe-11
</pre>

<p>Keep in mind that the precision is <em>not</em>
arbitrary; the exact number that you can actually expect to
get accurately varies depending on your computer, but it's
typically around 14 (a dozen four).</p>

<h2>Transdecimal Digits</h2>

<p><span class="prog">dec</span> always outputs using "X"
for ten and "E" for eleven; if you don't like this, you can
always filter your output through <span
class="prog">dozpret</span> and use whatever transdecimals
you want.</p>

<p><span class="prog">doz</span> is more flexible.  It will
accept "X", "x", "A", "a", "T", and "t" for ten, and it will
accept "E", "B", and "b" for eleven.  Notice that "e" is
<em>not</em> included, because it is used for exponential
notation.</p>

<p>You can mix these digits however you want:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; dec XxEtTaABb
4693695407.0000
</pre>

<p>And that's more or less all there is to using <span
class="prog">dec</span> and <span
class="prog">doz</span>.</p>
