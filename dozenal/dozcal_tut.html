<h1>dozcal:  A Tutorial</h1>

<p><span class="fl">D</span>ozcal is an extremely powerful
program, and learning to use it effectively will do a world
of good, as well as enable you to use the power of your
computer to help you keep your calendar in dozenal.  We'll
address things in steps:  first, we'll address how to let
<span class="prog">dozcal</span> know what you want to be
kept in your calendar; then, how to make <span
class="prog">dozcal</span> display what you want in the way
you want it; and finally, how to automate <span
class="prog">dozcal</span>'s behavior so that it will work
that way without you having to tell it to every time.</p>

<a name="data"></a>
<h2>Keeping a Calendar:  Your Data File(s)</h2>

<p>Dozcal knows about two types of file:  config files and
data files.  Your data file is what dozcal uses to determine
what information you want in your calendar:  it consists of
two types of entry, events and todos (that's "to do", as in
"things to do"), each of which is accompanied by a variety
of data.</p>

<h3>Events</h3>

<p>Events are the typical calendar entry:  "Our
anniversary", "Staff Meeting."  A typical event entry might
look like this:</p>

<pre class="demo">
[EVENT]
TITLE:  Vacation
START_DATE:  14 August 1200
END_DATE:  21 August 1200
LOCATION:  Nag's Head, North Carolina
INTERVAL:  1
CLASS:  private
CATEGORY:  vacation
CATEGORY:  personal
</pre>

<p>This entry uses almost all of the possible parameters for
an event.  The remaining four are START_TIME, END_TIME,
EXCEPT_DATE, and FREQ, which we'll examine in due time.</p>

<p><span class="sdemo">TITLE</span> is just what it sounds
like:  what the event should be called.  The icalendar
standard calls this the event's "description."  <span
class="sdemo">START_DATE</span> and <span
class="sdemo">END_DATE</span> are pretty self-explanatory;
the event will cover the dates beginning with the starting
date and ending with the end date.  Dates can be entered in
<a href="#dateentry">a variety of formats</a>.</p>

<p>If there are dates within your range (between your start
date and end date) that you <em>not</em> want included, name
it with <span class="sdemo">EXCEPT_DATE</span>; dozcal will
not include your event on any date so listed.  You can
include as many exception dates as you wish.</p>

<p><span class="sdemo">START_TIME</span> and <span
class="sdemo">END_TIME</span> are also pretty
self-explanatory.  If you omit either, dozcal will just
treat it as an all-day event.  If you include a start time
but no end time or vice versa, dozcal won't complain, but
note that the latter doesn't make much sense.  Times can
also be entered in <a href="#timeentry">a few different
formats</a>.</p>

<p><span class="sdemo">LOCATION</span> is an arbitrary
string, meaning exactly what it sounds like.</p>

<p><span class="sdemo">CLASS</span> is typically a single
word telling something about the event; e.g., "private",
"confidential."  <span class="sdemo">CATEGORY</span> is
also what it sounds like; you can include as many category
lines as you wish, and they will be displayed as a
comma-separated list.</p>

<p><span class="sdemo">INTERVAL</span> is how many days
until the next iteration of the event.  By default, it is
set at 1, and in our example, it is explicitly set at 1,
which is useless but harmless.  If it had been set at 2,
then <em>every other date</em> in the range would have been
included; that is, the "Vacation" event would have been on
14 August 1200 (the start date); then on 16 August 1200;
then on 18 August; then on 1X August; then on 20 August; and
that would end it.  If it had been set at 3, then <em>every
third day</em> in the range would have been included; that
is, the "Vacation" event would have been on 14 August 1200;
17 August 1200; 1X August 1200; and 21 August 1200.</p>

<p>Intervals are often useful with <a href="#freq">FREQ</a>,
which we'll see in due time.</p>

<a name="dateentry"></a>
<h4>Date Entry Formats</h4>

<p>Dates can be entered in the following formats:</p>

<center>
<table class="realtable">
<tr><td>year-mo-da</td></tr>
<tr><td>mo-da-year</td></tr>
<tr><td>da mon year</td></tr>
<tr><td>mon da, year</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>In the first two cases, the hyphens can be replaced by
forward slashes, as is common in the United States.  The
spaces are optional in the second two.  The month must be
listed with at least the first three letters (capital or
lowercase is irrelevant), but can be listed with more.  The
year must always be given as all four digits.</p>

<a name="timeentry"></a>
<h4>Time Entry Formats</h4>

<p>Time can be entered in the following formats:</p>

<center>
<table class="realtable">
<tr><td>HH:MM</td></tr>
<tr><td>HH;BB</td></tr>
<tr><td>HH;BBBB</td></tr>
<tr><td>HHBB</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>"H" stands for hours; "M" for minutes; "B" for biquas of
Tims, the standard TGM unit of time.  If the time includes a
colon, dozcal assumes that we're dealing with our standard
mongrel dozenal-sexagesimal time of hours and minutes, and
interprets it accordingly.  Otherwise, it assumes that we're
dealing with hours and Tims.</p>

<a name="freq"></a>
<h4>Frequency for Repetitive Events</h4>

<p>The only attribute for events that we haven't discussed
yet is <span class="sdemo">FREQ</span>,which provides a
generalized way to govern the frequency of an event.</p>

<p>FREQ works pretty simply:</p>

<ul>
<li>If there is the name of a weekday, then:</li>
<ul>
<li>If there is an ordinal number ("first"/"1st", etc.),
then:</li>
<ul>
<li>If there is a month name, then the event will be placed
on that ordinal weekday of that month whenever it falls
between the start date and end date; or, if there is no end
date, in the month named.  E.g., "third Tuesday in
April."</li>
<li>If there is no month name, then the event will be placed
on that ordinal weekday of every month in your range, or the
month of your start date if there is no end date.  E.g.,
"third Tuesdays."</li>
</ul>
<li>If there is no ordinal number, then it will be placed on
all of that weekday in your range, or in the month of your
start date (after the start date itself) if there is no end
date.  E.g., "Tuesdays."</li>
</ul>
<li>If there is not the name of a weekday, it looks for the
strings "monthly" or "yearly" (with no regard to
capitalization; the search is case-insensitive).  If it
finds "monthly", it will repeat the event every month from
the start date to the end date (or to the end of the
following year if there is no end date).  If it finds
"yearly", it will do the same every year.</li>
</ul>

<p>FREQ respects INTERVAL, so you can combine these in
interesting ways.  For example, by default INTERVAL is an
integer referring to a number of days (that's why there's no
"weekly"; you can just set INTERVAL to 7).  But if you've
put "monthly" in your FREQ, the interval will be counted by
<em>months</em>, not by days; so to set an event every other
month:</p>

<pre class="demo">
FREQ:  monthly
INTERVAL:  2
</pre>

<p>This also works with the more specific FREQ settings:</p>

<pre class="demo">
FREQ:  Tuesdays in April
INTERVAL:  2
</pre>

<p>This will set the first and third Tuesdays in April (and,
of course, the fifth if there is one); the INTERVAL being 2
makes it select every other Tuesday in April, rather than
every one.  A similar construction with a FREQ setting of
"monthly" and an INTERVAL of 2 will set an event in every
other month; or a FREQ setting of "monthly", a START_DATE
setting of "01 Jan 1200", and an INTERVAL of 3 will set the
event quarterly.</p>

<p>You can use up to 14 (one dozen four) FREQ directives,
and dozcal will respect all of them.  For example, say you
have a special meeting from 11;00-12;00 every second and
fourth Wednesday of the month.  The following will set it up
for you:

<pre class="demo">
TITLE:  Special Meeting
FREQ:  Second Wednesday
FREQ:  Fourth Wednesday
START_DATE:  01 Jan 1200
END_DATE:  27 Dec 1200
START_TIME:  11;00
END_TIME:  12;00
</pre>
