<h1>Downloading and Installing dozenal</h1>

<p><span class="fl">D</span>ownloading and installing
dozenal is pretty straightforward; an outside contribution
has significantly streamlined the build process.  So
presuming that you don't have a prebuilt version for your
distribution, you can read through this page.</p>

<h2>Downloading dozenal</h2>

<p>The dozenal source is all available at Github:</p>

<center>
<a href="http://www.github.com/dgoodmaniii/dozenal/">dozenal
source</a>
</center>

<p>Now, Github can be frightening for those who don't know
<a href="https://git-scm.com">git</a>, so for those who
can't navigate it, you can just download this archive:</p>

<center>
<a
href="https://github.com/dgoodmaniii/dozenal/archive/master.zip">zip
of dozenal source</a>
</center>

<p>If you <em>do</em> happen to know <a
href="https://git-scm.com">git</a>, then go ahead and work
your magic; clone that repository to your heart's
content.</p>

<h2>Installing dozenal</h2>

<p>This should also be pretty simple, even simpler than
usual, since dozenal does not include the usual "./configure"
step that most source downloads do.  I'll be assuming here
that you're working with the zip archive, since anyone who
knows enough <a href="https://git-scm.com">git</a> to clone
the repository will be able to figure out the rest for
themselves.</p>

<ol>
<li>Find the directory you want to put dozenal into, and go
to it.</li>
<li>Unzip the archive:
<pre class="demo">
unzip master.zip
</pre>
</li>
<li>Go to the directory that said unzipping created.  It
will be immediately beneath the directory that you
created.</li>
<li>Build the source:
<pre class="demo">
make
</pre>
</li>
<li>You now have a working dozenal in this directory.
Probably, however, you want more than that:  you want to be
able to run dozenal from any directory, read the manpage when
you need to, and so forth.  So become root however you
normally would (<strong>sudo</strong>, or <strong>su
-</strong>, or whatever), and run the following:
<pre class="demo">
make install
</pre>
That should cover it; you've now got dozenal running on your
computer.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you need help learning to run dozenal, visit the <a
href="doz_docs.html">documentation</a> page, where you'll
find both manuals and tutorials for the various programs.
And then, happy mathing!</p>
