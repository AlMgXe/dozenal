.SH NAME
dozstring \- conversion of string-embedded decimals to dozenals
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dozstring [-nxep] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dozstring
Inhales a string (which is considered any series of bytes
from start until EOF, including tabs and newlines) from
standard input, devours any decimal numbers it finds, and
emits the same string with the same length with the decimal
numbers converted to dozenal (base twelve), truncated or
padded as necessary.

This ensures that all strings will be printed the same
length as they came in.  Originally, this was devised to
convert index lines in the mutt mail client to be printed in
dozenal; preserving length was very important for this use
case.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -x
Indicates the character the user would like to use for digit
ten.  Defaults to 'X'.  Multicharacter string arguments will
be silently truncated.
.IP -e
Indicates the character the user would like to use for digit
eleven.  Defaults to 'E'.  Multicharacter string arguments
will be silently truncated.
.IP -p
Indicates the character the user would like to use to pad
numbers if necessary; e.g., if the decimal number is "11",
indicates the character to put to the left of "E" in the
converted result.  Defaults to '0'; so decimal "11" converts
to "0E".  Multicharacter string arguments will be silently
truncated.
.IP -n
Add a newline to the output.  Note that if standard input
ends in a newline, standard output will end with one
already.  However, if there is no newline in the standard
input, this option will add one to the output, as the last
byte.
