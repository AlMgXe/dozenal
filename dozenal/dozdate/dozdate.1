.SH NAME
dozdate \- produce the dozenal date and time
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dozdate [OPTION] [FORMAT]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dozdate
Display the current date and time in dozenal format, time
available in either standard sexagesimal time or TGM format;
or optionally a (more or less) arbitrary other date.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -d date_string
Rather than displaying current date and time, display the
date and time specified in the date string.  This string is
quite flexibly formatted, and is described in more detail
later in this manual.
.IP -f filename
Like -d once for each line of filename.
.IP -R
Display the date and time in RFC-2822 format.  E.g.:  "Mon, 07
Aug 11E2 10:2X:48 -0600"
.IP -c
Display the date and time in RFC-3339 format.  E.g.:
"111E2-08-07 10:2X:48-0600"
.IP -u
Display the date and time in UTC/GMT (Coordinated Universal
Time or Greenwich Mean Time); in other words, without time
zone or daylight savings time concerns.
.IP -v
Print version and copyright information, then quit.
.SH FORMAT
.B FORMAT 
controls the output; that is, inputting these sequences
(probably should enclose them in double quotes, just to be
sure) will produce the resulting figures.
.B Percent format sequences 
(beginning with a "%" and followed by a letter) produce
normal date and time numbers; 
.B at-sign format sequences
(beginning with an "@" and followed by a letter) produce
TGM-specific date and time numbers.  All numbers produced by
dozdate are dozenal, and all numbers fed to it are assumed
to be dozenal.

Interpreted sequences are:

.SH DOZENAL SEQUENCES:
.TP
@c
Produces a reasonably complete depiction of the date and
time; that is, weekday day month year time.  E.g., "Thu 18
Oct 11E7 0E;3300".
.TP
@C
Produces the first two digits of the dozenal year without
the last two; in other words, the zentury.  So, e.g., for
this year (11E7/2011), it produces "11".  Similar to %c,
except for the dozenal year.
.TP
@y
Produces the last two digits of the dozenal year without the
first two; so, for this year (11E7/2011), it produces "E7".
.TP
@t
Produces the number of Tims since the last hour
(0000-10000).  (Range is normally only through EEEE, but the
extra is to allow for occasional leap seconds.)
.TP
@m
Number of quaduaTims, to two places; essentially @t
truncated to two digits.
.TP
@H
Number of hours since midnight; 00-1E.
.TP
@k
Same as @H, but without padding; 0-1E.
.TP
@T
