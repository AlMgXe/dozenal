<h1>tgmconv:  A Tutorial</h1>

<p><span class="fl">T</span>gmconv is a broadly applicable
unit converter that can convert from U.S. customary,
imperial, SI metric, or imperial, into any of the same
systems.  It works entirely in dozenal, and can work with
complex units of arbitrary complexity.</p>

<a name="options"></a>
<h2>Command-Line Options</h2>

<p><span class="prog">tgmconv</span> sports some of the same
options as <a href="decdoz_tut.html">dec and doz</a> and <a
href="dozdc_tut.html">dozdc</a>; specifically, <span
class="sdemo">-k</span> for precision and <span
class="sdemo">-e</span> to get exponential notation in your
output.  These work precisely as they do in those other
programs, so there's no need to explain them further
here.</p>

<p>tgmconv does, however, have three additional command-line
options:  <span class="sdemo">-i</span>, <span
class="sdemo">-o</span>, and the final argument, which is
the quantity to be converted.</p>

<p>That final argument is simply a number, and doesn't
require much explanation; if you want to convert five
seconds into Tims, just use "5" as the final argument.  The
other two take <em>units</em> as their arguments; <span
class="sdemo">-i</span> takes the input unit, and <span
class="sdemo">-o</span> takes the output unit.  <span
class="prog">tgmconv</span> expects to see its units in a
particular format.  I've endeavored to make this format as
intuitive as possible; the user will have to judge whether
I've succeeded.</p>

<a name="unitsyn"></a>
<h2>Unit Syntax</h2>

<p>I've endeavored to make the unit syntax as simple and
intuitive as possible; but to make the program generally
applicable required a pretty complex system.  Fortunately,
for most common applications it's very simple, and more
complicated requirements can be addressed pretty quickly.
Below we treat the syntax for each of the unit systems known
by <span class="prog">tgmconv</span>, one at a time.</p>

<p>As this is a tutorial, not a manual, I won't be including
an exhaustive list of possible units and proper
abbreviations here.  Users should see the <a
href="tgmconv.html">manual</a> for that.</p>

<h3>TGM Units</h3>

<p>TGM units have a simple syntax; they are simply entered
with their canonical TGM abbreviation, which is always a
capital letter followed by one or more lowercase letters.
So, for example, "Grafut" is abbreviated "Gf", and is
entered as such:</p>

<pre class="demo">
-i Gf
</pre>

<p>TGM also offers an easy way to write when we're raising
or lowering a unit by a given power of 10 (the base,
twelve), similar to that offered by SI metric with its many
prefixes (such as "milli" and "kilo"):  this consists of a
number prefixed to the unit, superscripted if the power of
10 is positive and subscripted if the power of 10 is
negative.  This looks like the following normally:</p>

<center>
<sup>3</sup>Gf; <sub>6</sub>Gf
</center>

<p>Our formatting is more limited in plain text, though, so
what we do instead is utilize the symbols <span
class="sdemo">^</span> for superscripting and <span
class="sdemo">_</span> for subscripting, placed between the
digit and the unit, like so:</p>

<pre class="demo">
-i 3^Gf
-o 6_Gf
</pre>

<p>The above indicates that the input unit is triquaGrafut
(<sup>3</sup>Gf) and the output unit is hexciaGrafut
(<sub>6</sub>Gf).</p>

<p>TGM units can also be multiplied and divided in the same
way as SI and customary-imperial units; but since the method
is rarely necessary in TGM, with its very complete set of
basic units, we'll save the discussion of that for then.</p>

<h3>SI Metric Units</h3>

<p>Like TGM, each unit in SI metric has a canonical
abbreviation; e.g., "s" for seconds, "m" for meters, and
"Ci" for curies.  However, SI frequently requires compound
units, much more often than TGM (in which they are always
available but usually optional), so there's a defined syntax
for using such units.</p>

<p>Compound units are built by <em>multiplying</em> and
<em>dividing</em> simple ones; e.g., the unit of velocity is
distance divided by time.  In TGM, one can list this as
Gf/Tm (Grafut per Tim), but there is also a simple unit,
Vlos (Vl).  In SI, there is no such simple unit, so the
compound unit <em>must</em> be used.  So we express division
of units with the forward-slash, <span
class="sdemo">/</span>.  We express multiplication with the
asterisk, <span class="sdemo">*</span>.  Finally, we also
must exponentiate some units; acceleration, for example, is
meters per second <em>squared</em>.  We do exponentiation
simply by suffixing a digit to that unit; e.g., <span
class="sdemo">m/s2</span> for meters per second squared, or
meters per square second.</p>

<p>Sometimes quite complex units must be used, combining all
of these techniques; e.g., the unit of conductivity, in TGM
simply the Eldu, must be expressed as siemen-meters per
square meter, <span class="sdemo">S*m/m2</span>.</p>

<p>Any SI unit can also have a prefix indicating the power
of ten to which it is being raised or lowered; e.g., the
kilometer is the meter raised to the power of 3, while the
micrometer is the meter lowered to the power of 6.  SI does
not, however, permit a simple numerical abbreviation, as TGM
does; we must use these alphabetic prefixes.  <span
class="prog">tgmconv</span> embodies these prefixes in the
following forms:</p>

<center>
<table class="realtable">
<tr><th>Prefix</th><th>Abbr.</th>
	<th>Prefix</th><th>Abbr.</th></tr>
<tr><td>yotta</td><td>Y</td><td>yocto</td><td>y</td></tr>
<tr><td>zetta</td><td>Z</td><td>zepto</td><td>z</td></tr>
<tr><td>exa</td><td>Ex</td><td>atto</td><td>a</td></tr>
<tr><td>peta</td><td>Pe</td><td>femto</td><td>f</td></tr>
<tr><td>tera</td><td>Te</td><td>pico</td><td>p</td></tr>
<tr><td>giga</td><td>G</td><td>nano</td><td>n</td></tr>
<tr><td>mega</td><td>Me</td><td>micro</td><td>u</td></tr>
<tr><td>kilo</td><td>k</td><td>milli</td><td>m</td></tr>
<tr><td>hecta</td><td>h</td><td>centi</td><td>c</td></tr>
<tr><td>deka</td><td>da</td><td>deci</td><td>d</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>The user will note that these are all standard, except
for exa, peta, tera, and mega.  These had to be different
because, when combined with certain units, they conflicted
with certain TGM units; for example, the megagram, by
standard abbreviation "Mg", conflicts with the TGM Mag (Mg),
the unit of force.  So these four must be abbreviated in the
non-standard, but still intuitive, way shown above; all
others can be used as-is.</p>

<p>SI units modified by these prefixes can still be used in
compound units.</p>

<h3>Customary and Imperial Units</h3>

<p>These work more or less the same as metric units, except
that some common abbreviations for compound units will not
work.  For example, "miles per hour" is commonly abbreviated
"mph"; <span class="prog">tgmconv</span> will not understand
this at all.  Rather, it must be given as <span
class="sdemo">mi/hr</span>.  Similar, "psi" will not work
for "pounds per square inch"; this unit must be entered as
<span class="sdemo">lbf/in2</span>.</p>

<h2>Using tgmconv</h2>

<p>So putting it all together, we can use <span
class="prog">tgmconv</span> pretty simply.  Let's say we
want to convert seconds into Tims:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; tgmconv -i s -o Tm 1
5;9153
</pre>

<p>Or perhaps we'd like years convert into quadquaTims:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; tgmconv -i yr -o 4^Tm 3
13260
</pre>

<p>So three years is 13260 quadquaTim.  Or, perhaps we'd
like to see kilometers in quadquaGrafut:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; tgmconv -i km -o4^Gf "2;6"
0;4X87
</pre>

<p>So two and a half (2;6) kilometers is 0;4X87 of a
quadquaGrafut.</p>

<p>The input unit <em>can</em> be specified without the
<span class="sdemo">-i</span> option, if you include it as
part of the quantity to be converted.  You must then list
your final argument as the number, followed by some
non-dozenal character (that is, any character that could not
be part of a dozenal number), followed by the unit in its
usual abbreviation.  E.g., our last example could have been
entered thus:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; tgmconv -o4^Gf "2;6:km"
0;4X87
</pre>

<p>We have used a colon (<span class="sdemo">:</span>) for
the non-dozenal character separating the number from the
unit; however, any character could have been used as long as
it could not be confused for a part of the number.</p>

<p>Note that if you use both this method and the <span
class="sdemo">-i</span> option, <span
class="prog">tgmconv</span> will become very confused, and
if it manages to give you an answer at all, it will probably
be wrong.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>And that is <span class="prog">tgmconv</span>, a powerful
program for converting between metric systems in
dozenal.</p>
