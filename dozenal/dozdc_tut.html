<h1>dozdc:  A Tutorial</h1>

<p><span class="fl">D</span>ozdc is a powerful calculator
program, but it does take a bit of getting used to.  This
tutorial will review postfix notation ("Reverse Polish
notation," or RPN), which is used by <span
class="prog">dozdc</span>, then examine <span
class="prog">dozdc</span>'s particular facilities.</p>

<a name="postfix"></a>
<h2>Postfix Notation</h2>

<p>Postfix notation is actually, in some ways,
<em>better</em> than the way we're accustomed to writing our
math (which is called "infix notation").  Most especially,
it is <em>unambiguous</em>; there is no need for parentheses
for grouping, because it's always perfectly clear what is to
be done when.</p>

<p>Postfix notation utilizes a <em>stack</em>, to which and
from which numbers are <em>pushed</em> and <em>popped</em>.
Anytime a number is encountered, it is <em>pushed</em> onto
the stack.  When an operator is encountered, some of those
numbers are <em>popped</em> off the stack, the operation is
performed, and then the result is pushed back onto the
stack.  Eventually, all operations are completed, and the
stack is empty.</p>

<p>Let's look at a contrived example to see how this
works:</p>

<pre class="demo">
4 5 9 2 + * + 3 - =
</pre>

<p>We see first four numbers, and every time we encounter a
number, we <em>push</em> them onto the stack.  So our stack
now looks like this:</p>

<table class="stackdem">
<tr><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td></tr>
</table>

<p>And the rest of our equation looks like this:</p>

<pre class="demo">
+ * + 3 - =
</pre>

<p>(That is, that's the part of our equation that hasn't yet
been pushed onto the stack.)</p>

<p>But now we hit an <em>operator</em>, <span
class="sdemo">+</span>.  An operator is never pushed or
popped; rather, it pops certain things, does something to
them, then pushes the result back onto the stack.  An
operator may be <em>unary</em>, meaning that it pops one
number off the stack; <em>binary</em>, meaning that it pops
two; or even <em>ternary</em>, meaning that it pops
three.</p>

<p>We're all familiar with <span class="sdemo">+</span>;
it's a binary operator which produces the sum of its two
arguments.  So we <em>pop</em> two arguments from the stack,
add them together, then <em>push</em> the result back onto
the stack.  So we pop 2 and 9; we add them, to get E; and
then we push E back onto the stack:</p>

<table class="stackdem">
<tr><td>E</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td></tr>
</table>

<p>So our equation now looks like this:</p>

<pre class="demo">
* + 3 - =
</pre>

<p>Next is another operator, this time <span
class="sdemo">*</span>.  Remember the operators never get
pushed to the stack; they pop things, do something with
them, and then push the result.  <span
class="sdemo">*</span> is the multiplication operator; it
pops two items from the stack, multiplies them, then pushes
the result.  The top two items in our stack are E and 5; so,
in accordance with <span class="sdemo">*</span>, we pop the
two of them, multiply them to get the result of 47; then we
push that value back onto the stack.  Our stack then looks
like this:</p>

<table class="stackdem">
<tr><td>47</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td></tr>
</table>

<p>And our equation is:</p>

<pre class="demo">
+ 3 - =
</pre>

<p>And we see another operator, <span
class="sdemo">+</span>; by now we know what to do with it.
Pop the last two values, add them, then push the result.  So
we pop 47 and 4, add then to get 4E, and then push that
result back onto the stack.  Our stack is now:</p>

<table class="stackdem">
<tr><td>4E</td></tr>
</table>

<p>And our equation:</p>

<pre class="demo">
3 - =
</pre>


<p>If we get another binary or a ternary operator, we'll be
in trouble, as there are not enough numbers in the stack to
do what those operators want.  (We'd need at least two; but
we've only got one.)  Fortunately, the next item in our
equation is a number, not an operator; so we just push that
onto the stack:</p>

<table class="stackdem">
<tr><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>4E</td></tr>
</table>

<p>And our equation:</p>

<pre class="demo">
- =
</pre>

<p>And no we <em>do</em> meet another operator:
subtraction, the <span class="sdemo">-</span>.  This is
another binary operator, that pops two numbers, then
subtracts them, then pushes the result onto the stack.
Subtraction and division, however, are a bit different:
they pop the top two items on the stack, but they
<em>reverse</em> them before operating on them.  This is due
to the well-known principle that subtraction and division
are not <em>commutative</em>; if we don't put them in the
right order, we won't get the right answer.</p>

<p>So we pop 3 and 4E; we switch them around (giving us 4E
and 3); we subtract them; (4E - 3 = 48); and then we push
that value back onto the stack:</p>

<table class="stackdem">
<tr><td>48</td></tr>
</table>

<p>And our equation now only has word left:  <span
class="sdemo">=</span>.  This is the equals sign; for <span
class="prog">dozdc</span>, it means "pop a value off the
stack and print it."  There's only one number left on our
stack, 48; so <span class="sdemo">=</span> will pop that and
print it to your screen.  And now our stack and our equation
are both empty.</p>

<p>This all seems rather complicated; but here's what your
session in <span class="prog">dozdc</span> will actually
look like:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; dozdc "4 5 9 2 + * + 3 - ="
48
</pre>

<p>It takes a little time to get used to thinking in postfix
notation; but once you have, it becomes just as intuitive to
you as the way you wrote problems in elementary school.</p>

<p>Now that we've got some familiarity with postfix notation
in general, let's see what <span class="prog">dozdc</span>
specifically has to offer.</p>

<a name="operators"></a>
<h2>Command-Line Options and Operators</h2>

<p>The first and most important command-line option is the
equation itself.  This is the last option given to the
command line, and consists of the equation you want <span
class="prog">dozdc</span> to calculate, surrounded by
quotation marks:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; dozdc "0;2 sin 2 + ="
2;6000
</pre>

<p>Of course, <span class="prog">dozdc</span>, like all the
dozenal programs, is a well-behaved Unix program, so you can
also enter it and use it interactively by typing the command
without an argument:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; dozdc
0;2 sin 2 + =
2;6000
3;6 2 * =
7
quit
</pre>

<p>You can also feed it equations from standard input:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; echo "0;2 sin 2 + =" | dozdc
2;6000
</pre>

<p><span class="prog">dozdc</span> also has the <span
class="sdemo">-k</span> and <span class="sdemo">-e</span>
options, just as <span class="prog">dec</span> and <span
class="prog">doz</span> have, the former for controlling
precision of output and the latter for requesting output in
exponential notation:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; dozdc -k 2 "0;2 sin 2 + ="
2;60
$&gt; dozdc -e -k 2 "0;2 sin 58 * ="
2;9Ee1
</pre>

<p>As the second example above shows, <span
class="sdemo">-e</span> and <span class="sdemo">-k</span>
can be combined as one wishes.</p>

<p>Many of <span class="prog">dozdc</span>'s operators
assume that their arguments are <em>angles</em>, which
leaves the issue of what units the angles are expressed in.
<span class="prog">dozdc</span> assumes that all angles are
measured in <em>unciaPi</em>, the angular unit of TGM (each
unciaPi is one-twelfth (uncia) of a straight angle).
However, command-line arguments can tell <span
class="prog">dozdc</span> to read them as either degrees or
radians.  <span class="sdemo">-r</span> signals radians,
<span class="sdemo">-d</span> signals degrees:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; dozdc "0;2 sin ="
0;5EEE
$&gt; dozdc -d "26 sin ="
0;5EEE
$&gt; dozdc -r "1 sin ="
0;X120
</pre>

<p><span class="prog">dozdc</span> also provides operators
to perform these same functions within an equation; so if
you are in an interactive session and suddenly realize that
you need, say, radians rather than degrees, you can change
your setting within the session:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; dozdc -d
26 sin =
0;5EEE
rad
26 sin =
-0;EX33
</pre>

<p>The operators are <span class="sdemo">z</span>, to return to
unciaPi; <span class="sdemo">d</span> to use degrees; and
<span class="sdemo">rad</span> to use radians.</p>

<p>The rest of <span class="prog">dozdc</span>'s operators
are pretty self-explanatory; the manual is the best
reference for them.</p>

<a name="program"></a>
<h2>Programming</h2>

<p>One can due some (very) rudimentary programming with
<span class="prog">dozdc</span> alone (anything complex
would require using <span class="prog">dozdc</span> in
another programming language).  But for a few simple tasks,
<span class="prog">dozdc</span> has capabilities which will
suffice.</p>

<p>Because it is a well-behaved Unix program, <span
class="prog">dozdc</span> will take input from standard
input, even if redirected from a file.  It also has the
ability to assign values to named variables, so these
variables are no longer variable once they've been assigned
to.  So consider a file you've created to find the cube
roots of a variety of different numbers.  In <span
class="prog">dozdc</span>, roots are found by raising a base
to a fractional power using the operator <span
class="sdemo">^</span>.  E.g.:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; dozdc "8 1 3 / ^ ="
2
</pre>

<p>Rather than calculate the exponent repeatedly (that is,
doing <span class="sdemo">1 3 /</span> each time you want to
take a cube root), you can assign that value to a
variable.  Variables are any string of letters prefixed with
a dollar sign; they simply pop the last value off the stack,
and from then on that name is equivalent to that value in
your session.  So write the following in a file and name it
<span class="sdemo">dozdctest</span>:</p>

<pre class="demo">
1 3 / $cuberoot
8 $cuberoot ^ =
23 $cuberoot ^ =
</pre>

<p>Then you redirect this file to <span
class="prog">dozdc</span> on standard input:</p>

<pre class="demo">
$&gt; dozdc &lt; dozdctest
2
3
</pre>

<p>This is an extremely contrived example, not least because
the whole <span class="sdemo">$cuberoot</span> construction
could easily be replaced by <span class="sdemo">0;4</span>.
But it does give an idea of how to use <span
class="prog">dozdc</span>'s capabilities, should you need
them.</p>
